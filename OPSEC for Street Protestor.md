## INTRODUCTION
OPSEC is a systematic and proven process by which **Street Protestors** can deny to potential adversaries information about capabilities and intentions by identifying, controlling and protecting generally unclassified evidence of the planning and execution of sensitive protesting activities.

The principles of OPSEC are easy to remember:
- What information do you want to protect?
- Who wants your information?
- How is your information vulnerable?
- What is the risk for your information?
- How can you protect your information?

The OPSEC process involves five steps:
1. identification of critical information
2. analysis of threats
3. analysis of vulnerabilities
4. assessment of risk
5. application of appropriate countermeasures

## SCOPE
This plan will provide information designed to show all **Street Protestors**:
- what information needs to be protected
- what the threat is
- what the potential vulnerabilities are
- what to do with the risk
- what countermeasures can be applied to prevent information loss

This plan is applicable to all **Street Protestors**.

## DEFINITIONS
#### Critical Information (CI)
Critical Information is information concerning sensitive activities, whether classified or unclassified, which is vitally needed by adversaries or competitors for them to plan and act effectively.

CI is information about intentions, capabilities, or activities that must be protected from loss to keep an adversary from gaining a significant military, economic, political, or technological advantage.

The process to identify critical information begins with an examination of the totality of the activities involved in performance of **Street Protestors** to determine what exploitable but unclassified evidence of classified or sensitive activity is vulnerable to adversary acquisition in light of the known capabilities of potential adversaries.

Such evidence is usually derived from openly available data.

Certain “indicators” may be pieced together or interpreted to discern critical information.

Indicators commonly stem from the routine administrative, physical, or technical actions taken to prepare for or execute the protest.

#### Indicators
Indicators are sources of information that, if exploited by an adversary or competitor, could reveal critical information.

An indicator can be identified by asking the question, “If I were an adversary or competitor, where would I go to obtain critical information?”

Indicators are detectable actions that can be heard, observed, or imaged.

Obtained by an adversary, they could result in adversary knowledge or actions harmful to friendly intentions.

They include such things as personnel or material actions and movements that can be observed, public release conversations or documents, and habitual procedures when conducting a given type of operation or test.

All detectable indicators that convey or infer critical information must be identified and protected if determined vulnerable.

#### Threat Analysis
Threat Analysis is a process in which information about a threat or potential threat is subjected to systematic and thorough examination in order to identify significant facts and derive conclusions.

Threat analysis is an examination of an adversary’s technical and operational capabilities, motivation, and intentions to detect and exploit security vulnerabilities.

When considering a threat, one must look at the situation in general and look at that information as an adversary would.

A determination will need to be made as to:
- who would want this information
- who would want to discredit the **Street Protestors**
- who would like to cause harm to the **Street Protestors**
- who would like to do other nefarious activities directed at the **Street Protestors**.

Once the adversary (ies) is/are established, an analysis also needs to be done on capabilities, access, determination, etc.

#### Analysis of Vulnerabilities
Analysis of vulnerabilities is a systematic evaluation process in which qualitative and/or quantitative techniques are applied to detect vulnerabilities and to arrive at an effectiveness level for a safeguards and security system to protect specific targets from specific adversaries and their acts.

Determining vulnerabilities involves a systematic analysis of how the protest is actually conducted by the **Street Protestors**.

The situation must be viewed as an adversary might view it.

Actions and things that can be observed or other data that can be interpreted or pieced together to derive critical information must be identified.

These potential vulnerabilities must be matched with specific threats.

Once it is determined what an adversary needs to know and where that information is available, it is necessary to determine if it is possible for the adversary to acquire and exploit the information in time to capitalize on it.

If so, vulnerability exists.

#### Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is an evaluation of potential threats against a safeguard and security interest and the countermeasures necessary to address potential vulnerabilities.

It is a five-step process that provides the decision-maker with a firm foundation upon which to make an informed decision.

During a risk assessment, the value of the information, analysis of the threat, and determination of the information’s vulnerability are conducted.

Following the completion of these three activities, a determination of the risk rating is made and countermeasures are considered and implemented, as necessary.

Risk assessment is essentially the process of balancing vulnerability against the threat, then deciding if the resultant risk warrants applications of countermeasures.

The determination of risk is a demanding step in the OPSEC Process.

It requires a degree of subjective decision making based on the best estimate of an adversary’s intentions and capabilities.

Included in the assessment of an adversary’s capability is not only his ability to collect the information but also his capability to process and exploit (evaluate, analyze, interpret) in time to make use of the information.

In order to complete the risk assessment, it is necessary to combine this information (i.e., the possibility of the adversary exploiting the information, with the resultant impact on the **Street Protestors**).

This process should result in a list of recommendations along with an estimate of the reduced impact upon the operation as achieved through their application.

The decision maker can then weigh the cost of recommended OPSEC countermeasures in terms of resources and operational effectiveness against the impact of the loss of critical information.

#### Application of Appropriate Countermeasures
A countermeasure is anything that effectively negates an adversary’s ability to exploit vulnerabilities.

The most effective countermeasures are simple, straightforward, procedural adjustments that effectively eliminate or minimize the generation of indicators.

Following a cost-benefit analysis, countermeasures are implemented in priority order to protect vulnerabilities having the most impact on the **Street Protestors**, as determined by the appropriate decision maker.
